# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
## Project Description
A project to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

## Contents
This repo consist of 
  1) A tidy data set
  2) A R script called run_TidyDatAnalysis.R that does the following.
      * i.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
      ii.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
      iii.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
      iv.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
      v.From the data set in step iv, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  3) a code book called CodeBook.md that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or the work being performed to clean up the data.

is use to demonstrate this analysis. Data is collected through a series of experiments to a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years by performing six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
